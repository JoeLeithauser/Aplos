# Project Title

Baseball Fantasy League Drafting App

## Description

I built this application in Palantir because it was very time consuming to download and cleanse data and build spreadsheets to draft my team. This application automates much of the work I did manually before and with AI built in allows me to check my biases at the door. This is a simulation style fantasy league focused on OBP and SLG, not a more traditional “Rotisserie” style league with categories and counting stats. My information can be found on Scoresheet.com

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* It runs on Palantir and uses Pipeline Builder, Ontology and Workshop


### Installing

* The program should not need installation, only a Palantir login and access to the project
* Modifications to the data should be made in Pipeline Builder should result in a new or changed Ontology
* Application modifications should be made in Workshop

### Executing program

* Running the application is easy, just access the application. 
* All data is available on the main screen. It is sorted by OPS (on base % + slugging %)
* Players that are taken can be marked with the check box and the “Already Taken” button will update their status.
* To make a player available, put a mark in the check box next to their name and click the “Available” button
* To use the AI to compare two place indicate the players to compare by using the check box, then select the appropriate AI prompt
